# Kevin Cozart  
**C++ Developer | Senior IT Systems Administrator | U.S. Marine Corps Veteran**  
*Building a strong foundation in modern C++ with interests in audio, graphics, and performance-aware software.*

👋 **Hi there!** I'm Kevin Cozart — an IT Systems Administrator with over 10 years of production infrastructure experience and a Computer Science degree, building a growing foundation in modern C++ software development.

My background spans systems administration, networking, virtualization, automation, and reliability-focused operations. Alongside my IT career, I’ve pursued software development through coursework and personal learning projects, focusing on C++, performance-aware design, and low-level problem solving.

I’m particularly interested in real-time audio processing, graphics programming concepts, and performance-focused C++ code, and I use GitHub to document learning projects, experiments, and technical growth.
